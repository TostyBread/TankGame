If you've read the in-game credits, yes, that's my real name and Im not just Alan. (thats my nickname)
This game was created 5 or 6 weeks ago, but lecturer is too ass at providing useful codes to make anything that
he "required" our game to be "interesting". So ill admit that half of the code is with the help of ChatGPT
(with some internet searching) and me doing the reading and changes as neccessary. Otherwise this game would be
lame as shit and viable for "arbitary assignment requirements".

But still, I only actively working on it for about 5 days straight excluding class time (since those times I was drawing
graphics for the game). Basically working tirelessly morning till night (which is not effective, I know) until I was satisfied
with some more interesting stuff being learned rather than relying what lecture is giving.

And temper your expectations too, since this game is barebones and lacking any replayability. (and probably frustrating for some)

Version 1.0 Notes:

- Enemy tank patrol fixed, now they wont stuck at each other
- Implement tank engine SFX for this build (Removed previously due to lecture being an ass)
- "Guard-rail" implemented due to horrible gameplay flow (Didn't have time to implement enemy location marker)


Version 1.1 Notes:

- Enemy wont shoot you through undestructable obstacles, they will wait until you're in their line of fire (make them feel smarter)
- Added pause menu
